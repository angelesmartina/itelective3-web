An **attendance monitoring system** is a software or hardware solution that is used to track and record employee attendance. The purpose of such a system is to accurately record when employees start and end their work shifts, as well as any breaks or absences that they may have.

There are several sub-systems that may be included in an attendance monitoring system, depending on the specific needs and requirements of the organization:

1. **Time and attendance tracking**: This sub-system is used to record when employees start and end their work shifts, as well as any breaks or absences that they may have. This can be done manually (e.g. through a paper-based time sheet) or automatically (e.g. through the use of time clocks or biometric scanners).

2. **Leave management**: This sub-system is used to track and manage employee leave requests, including vacation, sick leave, and other types of absences. It may include features such as the ability to request and approve leave online, as well as the ability to track leave balances and accruals.

3. **Scheduling**: This sub-system is used to create and manage employee schedules. It may include features such as the ability to create and publish schedules in advance, as well as the ability to track and manage shift swaps and other schedule changes.

4. **Payroll integration**: Some attendance monitoring systems may include the ability to integrate with payroll software, allowing for easy calculation and tracking of employee pay based on attendance and other factors.

5. **Reporting and analytics**: Many attendance monitoring systems include features for generating reports and performing data analysis on attendance data. This may include the ability to create custom reports and track attendance trends over time.
